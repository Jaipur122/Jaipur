    <h1>Food culture</h1>
<p>
In Indian cuisine, spices play just as big of a role as the other ingredients. Every spice is added for a reason - not only because they taste good, but because they are nutritious.

Indian food is well-known across the world and widely spread. However, it is rarely made justice when served in other countries since it in many western parts of the world almost has turned into fast food.
Thatâ€™s why we would strongly recommend you to enjoy some actual Indian food.
<h2>Here are some places to do that in Jaipur:</h2>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Suarna Mahal</li>
    <li>Cinnamon</li>
    <li>The Royal Root</li>
</ul>


<h2>On top of that, here are some famous Jaipur-meals</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Pyaz kachori, a fried pastry pocket filled with spicy onion <img src="img/pyaz.jpeg" alt="Picture of pyaz kachori"></li>
    <li>Ghevar, a sweet cake with pistachio, saffron and almonds <img src="img/ghevar.jpeg" alt="Picture of ghevar"></li>
    <li>Feeni, a sugary dessert that is typical during wintertime <img src="img/feeni.jpeg" alt="Picture of feeni"></li>
</ul>

<small>Tip: A lot of dishes served in Indian restaurants are meat-free by default due to hindu traditions, making them vegetarian-friendly!</small>
