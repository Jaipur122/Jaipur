    <h1>Food culture</h1>
<p>
In Indian cuisine, spices play just as big of a role as the other ingredients. Every spice is added for a reason - not only because they taste good, but because they are nutritious.

Indian food is well-known across the world and widely spread. However, it is rarely made justice when served in other countries since it in many western parts of the world almost has turned into fast food.
Thatâ€™s why we would strongly recommend you to enjoy some actual Indian food. </p>
