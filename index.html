        <p class="p1">Jaipur is, as the capital of largest state of India - Rajasthan,
        a very attractive city in the northern parts of the country.
        About 100 years after the rise of the city, which took place in the 18th century,
        Jaipur and all its buildings were painted pink to greet travellers.
        Pink is said to be the color of hospitality and the thought was that it would make visitors,
        like the prince of Wales, feel more welcome upon their arrival.
        </p>

        <p class="p2">We hope that you too will feel drawn to Jaipur and officially invite you to visit.
        Come see the pink city and discover all its charms.
        You won't be disappointed!
        It is also almost guaranteed that you won't get lost in Jaipur,
        as it is both surrounded by a 6 meter tall wall,
        as well as built with a unique grid system making it extremely easy to navigate in the city.
        Don't believe us? Come prove us wrong!
